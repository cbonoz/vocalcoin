# Vocal Coin
A Minimally Viable Distributed Political Currency.
---

Vocal is a currency platform for promoting social change and civic engagement.

We have an open beta website at https://www.vocalcoin.com (enter https://vocalcoin.com manually in browser window if page doesn't load initially).

### What Vocal Solves:

- Engagement in politics is declining in younger demographics, engaging in political issues can seem intimidating, and sometimes not immediately accessible*.
- Often little transparency into others opinions and issues happening around me.
- Vocal offers an immutable ledger of votes and issue creation (using the Neo blockchain) that serves as proof of when votes/issues were created.
- Lack of a universal incentive system for political participation. We now propose/create that system through the use of Vocal coin - which can be redeemed for agenda promotion, issue creation (and other things to come) through a traceable currency.
- No widely accessible platform for political engagement and discovery on a local / map scale.
- Yelp-like platform enables map-search of active political issues. Quickly and easily find the issues that are most pertinent to you and your community, without having to sift through a huge world of political agendas and issues.

### How it works:

<ol>
    <li>User signs up for a vocal account (this will automatically create a 'Vocal' wallet for that user that is either owned by them or managed by the Vocal platform) </li>
    <li>User earns Vocal coin by casting votes on particular government or other individuals' issues</li>
    <li>User redeems those vocal token for promoting his or her own initiatives (and/or social credit i.e. user gains publicity). Other opportunities for redemption can be possible in the future.</li>
    <li>Governments can also promote and add issues that they want information about from local communities, questions such as 'What would be the most valuable improvement to this town? Or should we make this investment?'</li>
</ol>
